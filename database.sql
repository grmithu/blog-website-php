Mobile internet access was restricted on July 16 amidst country-wide protests against quota reinstatement in government jobs. Following escalating street violence, a complete internet blackout was suddenly imposed on July 18, with no prior warning. Now, the country\'s freelancers, whose income depends heavily on internet access, are facing significant financial difficulties.\r\n\r\nTimely communication is paramount in online freelancing platforms like Fiverr and Upwork. Freelancers typically rely on the platforms\' embedded messaging systems to communicate with clients. Unfortunately, the internet shutdown rendered communication entirely impossible.\r\n\r\nThe global freelancing marketplace operates at a fast pace, with clients and workers adhering to strict deadlines for project orders and deliveries. Failure to deliver on time often results in negative client feedback, which can significantly impact a freelancer\'s earnings if enough negative ratings accumulate.', '4265596__mg_9060_copy.jpg', 10, 9, 1, 'freelancer', '2024-08-02'),

Including the chips made by Google, Amazon.com, and other cloud computing companies, Nvidia commands roughly 80% of the market.\r\n\r\nIn the research paper, Apple did not explicitly say that it used no Nvidia chips, but its description of the hardware and software infrastructure of its AI tools and features lacked any mention of Nvidia hardware.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone maker said that to train its AI models, it used two flavours of Google\'s tensor processing unit (TPU) that are organised in large clusters of chips. To build the AI model that will operate on iPhones and other devices, Apple used 2,048 of the TPUv5p chips. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPUv4 processors.\r\n\r\n', '626238_apple_store.jpg', 10, 9, 1, 'apple', '2024-08-02'),
